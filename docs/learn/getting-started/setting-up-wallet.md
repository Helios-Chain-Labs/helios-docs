# Setting Up a Wallet

Helios is **EVM-compatible**, meaning it supports **any Ethereum-based wallet**. Additionally, it can integrate with **Cosmos-compatible wallets** for broader interoperability.

## Supported Wallets

You can use any **EVM-compatible** wallet, such as:

- **Metamask**
- **Rabby**
- **Trust Wallet**
- **Coinbase Wallet**
- **Frame**

For **Cosmos-based interactions**, you can use:

- **Keplr**
- **Leap**
- **Cosmostation**

While Cosmos wallets can interact with Helios, **they are not required** unless you need Cosmos-specific functionality.

## Installing a Wallet

1. **Metamask (or any EVM wallet)**  
   - Download from the [official Metamask website](https://metamask.io/).
   - Follow the installation steps and create a new wallet or import an existing one.
   - Secure your **seed phrase** and store it offline.

2. **Keplr (if using Cosmos features)**  
   - Download from the [Keplr official website](https://www.keplr.app/).
   - Follow the installation guide and connect to your preferred networks.

## Adding the Helios Network to Your Wallet

Once your wallet is installed, you need to **add the Helios RPC details**. Follow the steps in [Connecting to the Helios Network](./connecting-to-network) for the full setup.
