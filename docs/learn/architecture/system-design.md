# System Design

While Helios operates on Cosmos SDK as a base, it has been heavily modified with a mix of EVMOS, Injective, Cronos, and Ethermint, along with its own unique consensus and interoperability systems.

## Architectural Layers

Helios is structured into multiple layers that enhance efficiency and security:

### 1. Execution Layer
- Built on Cosmos SDK with significant enhancements from EVMOS, Injective, Cronos, and Ethermint.
- Fully EVM-compatible, allowing seamless deployment of Ethereum-based smart contracts.
- Supports Cosmos-native applications, enabling hybrid EVM & Cosmos interoperability.

### 2. Consensus Layer (I-PoSR)
- Implements Interchain Proof of Stake and Reputation (I-PoSR), which combines:
  - Traditional PoS staking with reputation-weighted validator selection.
  - Multi-chain staking across different blockchain ecosystems.
  - Adaptive slashing that penalizes malicious validators dynamically.

### 3. Networking Layer
- Uses libp2p for peer-to-peer (P2P) communication.
- Manages validator coordination, message propagation, and cross-chain data syncing.

### 4. Hyperion Modules (Interoperability & Oracle Layer)
- Hyperion serves as a multi-chain oracle and bridge.
- Based on Peggy from Injective, a battle-tested cross-chain system that has secured over $1 billion in assets.
- Ensures secure asset transfers, decentralized oracles, and validator-driven cross-chain data verification.
- Allows Helios to interact with Ethereum and other EVM chains safely.

### 5. Governance and Automation Layer
- On-chain governance handles network upgrades, staking rules, and asset integration.
- AI-powered decision-making assists in:
  - Optimizing staking reward structures.
  - Analyzing governance proposals and suggesting weight adjustments.
- Supports dynamic staking incentives that adjust based on market conditions.

## How Helios Ensures Efficient Operation
Helios' system design enhances scalability, decentralization, and cross-chain interactions through the following key mechanisms:

### Optimized Transaction Processing in Cosmos-Based Consensus
- Helios operates on Cosmos SDK, meaning execution and consensus occur on the same validator nodes.
- Transactions are validated, executed, and finalized within blocks, ensuring deterministic processing.
- Unlike Ethereumâ€™s rollup-based chains, Helios does not decouple execution from consensus. Instead, it optimizes validator selection and transaction inclusion using its reputation-weighted mechanics.

### Battle-Tested Cross-Chain Data Validation
- Hyperion Modules act as cross-chain verifiers, ensuring Helios validators receive accurate external data before confirming transactions.
- Built on Peggy from Injective, Hyperion inherits the security of a bridge framework that has already handled over $1B+ in cross-chain deposits.
- Each Hyperion Module functions as a light client for an external chain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana), allowing Helios to process cross-chain operations natively.

### Reputation-Weighted Staking for Long-Term Security
- Validators are chosen based on both staked assets and reputation.
- Higher-reputation validators gain priority in selection, ensuring that network security is not dictated solely by token holdings.
- This prevents large staking monopolies while rewarding consistent, high-performing validators.

These architectural choices allow Helios to scale efficiently while maintaining decentralization, security, and cross-chain functionality.

## Example: How a Transaction Flows Through Helios
1. Transaction Submission  
   A user submits a transaction on Helios (e.g., a smart contract interaction or a cross-chain bridge request).

2. Validation & Consensus  
   - The Execution Layer verifies the transaction.
   - The Consensus Layer (I-PoSR) processes and confirms it using validators with high reputation scores.

3. Cross-Chain Execution (If Needed)  
   - If the transaction involves an external chain, a Hyperion Module verifies and relays the data.
   - The Networking Layer ensures transaction details are synchronized across connected blockchains.

4. Finalization & Block Inclusion  
   - Once validated, the transaction is finalized and recorded on Helios.
   - Staking rewards and governance updates adjust dynamically based on validator activity.

## Why This System Design?
Helios combines scalability, decentralization, and security to create an optimized blockchain network:
- More Secure: Multi-chain staking and battle-tested bridging (Peggy-based) ensure maximum protection.
- More Efficient: AI optimizations improve staking rewards and governance decision-making.
- More Scalable: Modular execution allows seamless integration with new blockchain innovations.
