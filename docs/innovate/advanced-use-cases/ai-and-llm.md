# AI And LLM

## Overview

Each node on the Helios blockchain has the capability to install and activate AI agents. These agents are designed to enhance user interactions, facilitate token swaps, autonomously participate in proposals for validators, smart contract interaction, and provide a variety of other utilities.

## Key Features of AI Agents

- **User Interaction**: AI agents can assist users in navigating the Helios ecosystem, providing real-time support and guidance for various operations.

- **Automated Swaps**: Users can leverage AI agents to execute token swaps automatically, optimizing trading strategies based on market conditions.

- **Proposal Participation**: AI agents can autonomously participate in governance proposals, allowing validators to optimize their decision-making processes based on network health and performance metrics.

- **Multi-Validators Optimization**: The AI agents can act as validator assistants, optimizing stakes across multiple validators to maximize rewards and enhance network security.

## Integration from MetaMask

Helios also offers a MetaMask extension that allows users to interact seamlessly with the main wallet management agent of Helios. This integration enables users to perform various actions through RPC calls on Helios nodes, enhancing the overall user experience.

## AI Agent with LLM

The AI agents on Helios are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to perform complex tasks such as:

- **Governance Bot**: The AI agent can propose and vote on governance issues based on the health of the network, ensuring that decisions are made in the best interest of the community.

- **Validator Assistant**: By analyzing data across Helios concensus, the AI agent can optimize staking and boost strategies, helping validators maximize their returns while maintaining network integrity.

## Conclusion

The integration of AI agents within the Helios blockchain represents a significant advancement in how users and validators can interact with the network. By leveraging AI technology, Helios aims to create a more efficient, user-friendly, and autonomous blockchain experience.
