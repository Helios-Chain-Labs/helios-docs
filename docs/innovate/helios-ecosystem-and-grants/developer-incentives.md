# Developer Incentives

## Welcome to Helios

As a Web3 developer with a groundbreaking idea, a whitepaper, or even a minimum viable product (MVP), it's time to build, test, and launch your protocol on a smart contract-enabled blockchain. With numerous options available, Helios stands out as an exceptional choice for your development needs. Hereâ€™s why.

## Why Helios?

Helios is a next-generation blockchain designed for interchain automation secured by important valued assets, AI-powered smart contracts, and decentralized governance. Unlike traditional blockchains that operate in isolation, Helios bridges multiple ecosystems, allowing assets / restaked assets, smart contracts, and validators to work seamlessly across various chains.

### Key Features of Helios

- **Native EVM Support**: Developers can write smart contracts in Solidity. Deploy and execute Ethereum-compatible smart contracts while leveraging Helios-native functionalities.

- **Solidity In Boosted Mode**: Helios brings freshness to Solidity with Autonomous CRON Tasks, Interacting With AI Agents and Cross-Chain Oracle Capabilities.

- **Interoperability**: Helios is built from the ground up for cross-chain interaction, supporting multiple blockchain ecosystems such as Ethereum, Cosmos, and Solana. This allows developers to create applications that works across different networks without modification.

- **Secure Cross-Chain Bridging**: Helios' modular architecture ensures safe and efficient asset transfers between different blockchain ecosystems.

- **AI-Driven Automation**: Helios integrates AI-powered automation to enhance blockchain functionality, enabling smart contracts to dynamically adapt to network conditions and automate governance processes.

- **Reputation-Based Consensus**: Helios introduces a performance-driven model where validators build reputation over time, ensuring trust and security across the network.

- **Composable Applications**: Build dApps that interact with assets and protocols across multiple blockchains without friction.

## Compatibility and Composability

Helios supports EVM-compatible smart contracts, protocols, and tooling, making it easy for project teams from other blockchains to migrate their dApps to Helios. The integration of Hyperion Modules allows for seamless cross-chain interactions, enabling users to bring their assets to Helios while maintaining smooth on-chain operations.

With support for popular programming languages and comprehensive documentation, developers can quickly start and deploy their applications on a blockchain designed with real-world use cases in mind.

## Fast Block Finality and Cost-Effective Transactions

Helios employs a unique consensus mechanism that combines Interchain Proof of Stake and Reputation (I-PoSR), allowing for faster block finality times and lower transaction costs. This efficient consensus model enhances the overall user experience while maintaining network security.

## A Thriving Ecosystem

The Helios community actively engages through various channels, including social media, forums, and developer meetups, fostering collaboration and innovation.
