# Interchain Governance

Helios introduces a multi-chain governance model that extends beyond a single blockchain, leveraging staked assets from multiple networks, Hyperion modules, and the I-PoSR consensus to form a decentralized decision-making system that spans across multiple chains.

Unlike traditional governance models, Helios governance accounts for cross-chain voting power, validator reputation, and interchain activity, creating a governance DAO that dynamically adapts to interchain conditions.

## Multi-Chain Governance DAO Model

### How Interchain Governance Works
Governance in Helios is structured around staked assets, validator reputation, and Hyperion contributions, ensuring that decisions reflect the security and economic state of all integrated blockchains.

Key factors affecting governance weight:
- Assets from multiple chains contribute to governance influence.
- Validators securing external chains gain additional governance power.
- Reputation from Hyperion operations enhances decision-making authority.

Governance proposals extend beyond Helios itself, affecting interchain connectivity, Hyperion security, and cross-chain asset management.

### Why Multi-Chain Governance Matters
Unlike single-chain DAOs, Helios governance decisions are shaped by multiple blockchain economies. This means:
- Governance weight is not limited to Helios-native tokens, ensuring a fairer distribution of decision-making power.
- Validators securing external assets through Hyperion gain influence, since their economic stake extends beyond Helios itself.
- The interchain DAO model allows Helios to react to security threats, economic shifts, and cross-chain opportunities faster than a traditional governance structure.

## Interchain Staking Power & Cross-Chain Governance
Since Helios validators stake assets from multiple chains, governance voting weight is calculated based on the total interchain stake, rather than being restricted to a single asset.

| Staking Source       | Influence in Governance |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Staked HELIOS       | ✅ Boost other assets |
| Staked ETH (via Hyperion) | ✅ Contributes to voting power |
| Staked ATOM (via Hyperion) | ✅ Contributes to voting power |
| Validator Reputation | ✅ Boosts governance weight |
| Hyperion Activity   | ✅ Validators securing external chains gain governance priority |

Validators securing multiple networks through Hyperion gain higher decision-making power, as they contribute to securing assets beyond Helios itself.

## Hyperion’s Role in Interchain Governance
Hyperion Modules allow Helios to interface with external blockchains, making them essential for interchain governance.

Governance decisions include:
- Enabling or disabling Hyperion Modules for specific blockchains.
- Adjusting staking incentives for different Hyperion-connected chains.
- Modifying cross-chain transaction security parameters to prevent risks.

### Enabling or Disabling Hyperion Chains
The community can vote to integrate or disable a blockchain from the Hyperion system.

- Example 1: Adding a new chain
  - A governance proposal requests integration of Solana into Hyperion.
  - Validators vote on feasibility, security, and adoption.
  - If approved, the Solana Hyperion Module is activated, allowing staking and bridging.

- Example 2: Disabling an insecure Hyperion connection
  - If a blockchain faces security concerns, a governance vote can pause its Hyperion integration.
  - Votes determine whether to halt, adjust, or permanently remove the chain from Helios.

## Cross-Chain Treasury Governance
Slashed assets from misbehaving validators across multiple chains are collected into the Helios Treasury, which is governed by the Helios Foundation.

Possible governance actions:
- Burn a percentage of slashed assets to stabilize the economy.
- Reallocate funds to ecosystem incentives or staking pools.
- Use assets for liquidity provision to support staking rewards.

Since Helios operates interchain slashing, governance controls assets that originate from multiple networks, ensuring decentralized treasury management.
