# Security & Best Practices

## Ensuring Validator & Network Security
Helios integrates multiple layers of security to safeguard validator operations and delegatorsâ€™ funds.

### Slashing Mechanisms
Helios employs slashing to penalize malicious or negligent validators, ensuring network integrity.

| Type of Violation  | Penalty |
|------------------------|------------|
| Downtime (Extended offline period) | Partial slashing + Reputation loss |
| Double Signing (Signing conflicting blocks) | Severe slashing + Validator removal |
| Malicious Activity (Fraudulent behavior, exploit attempts) | Maximum slashing + Reputation reset |

- Reputation loss is proportional to the severity of the violation.
- Validators with extremely low reputation are removed from the active validator set.
- Slashed assets are redirected to the Helios Treasury, supporting the ecosystem.

### Hyperion-Enabled Reputation Boost
Validators running Hyperion Modules (participating in cross-chain validation) receive an additional reputation boost, making them more trusted in governance and staking.

Validators with higher Hyperion participation:
- Gain a higher reputation score.
- Have more influence in governance.
- Are preferred for staking by delegators due to lower slashing risks.

## Best Practices for Validators
To maintain a strong reputation and avoid penalties, validators should:

1. Ensure High Uptime  
   - Maintain at least 99% uptime to avoid downtime slashing.  
   - Use failover nodes or redundant infrastructure to minimize disruptions.

2. Use Secure Key Management  
   - Store private keys using hardware wallets or secure enclaves.  
   - Rotate validator keys periodically for enhanced security.

3. Monitor Network & Logs  
   - Regularly check Helios Explorer and Validator Dashboard for updates.  
   - Set up alerts for unexpected network behavior.

4. Run Hyperion Modules for Extra Protection  
   - Increase reputation score and governance power.
   - Gain higher delegator trust for more staking rewards.

## Best Practices for Delegators
As a delegator, choosing the right validator is crucial to protect your funds and maximize rewards.

### How to Choose a Validator Safely
| Factor | Why It Matters |
|------------|-------------------|
| Reputation Score | Higher scores indicate trusted, stable validators. |
| Hyperion Participation | Validators running Hyperion Modules are more secure. |
| Slashing History | Avoid validators with frequent penalties. |
| Commission Rate | Lower fees mean higher rewards for delegators. |
| Delegation Spread | A well-distributed stake prevents centralization risks. |

### Diversify Delegations
- Spread staking across multiple validators to reduce risks.
- Monitor validator performance in [Helios Gate](https://portal.helioschain.network).

### Auto-Compounding Rewards
Delegators can automate reward reinvestment to maximize long-term APY.
- Available via Helios Gate or manual redelegation using the CLI.

## Helios Treasury & Slashed Assets
Helios redistributes slashed assets to the Helios Treasury, which can be governed by the community.

### Treasury Uses
- Funding network improvements & security audits.
- Supporting Helios token buybacks (if voted by governance).
- Providing staking incentives to validators with strong reputations.

Governance can decide how slashed funds are used, ensuring transparency and decentralization.

## Final Thoughts
Helios is designed to reward long-term, reliable participation while penalizing malicious actors. By following best practices, both validators and delegators can maximize security and earnings.
